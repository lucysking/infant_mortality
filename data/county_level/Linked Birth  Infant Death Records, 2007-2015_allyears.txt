Caveats:
"1. 'Suppressed' appears instead of death, birth, and rate values when the death value represents 0-9 sub-national events. This"
"is because the data do not meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"2. 'Unreliable' appears for rates when there are fewer than 20 deaths in the numerator. This is because the figure does not meet"
"the NCHS standard of reliability or precision. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#Unreliable."
"3. Infant deaths are weighted so numbers may not exactly add to totals due to rounding. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#WeightFactors-Totals."
"4. Note that there may be slight differences in the number of infant deaths when comparing the Linked Birth / Death Records to"
