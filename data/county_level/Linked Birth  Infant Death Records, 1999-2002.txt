Caveats:
"1. Infant deaths are weighted so numbers may not exactly add to totals due to rounding. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#WeightFactors-Totals."
"2. 'Suppressed' appears instead of death, birth, and rate values when the death value represents 0-9 sub-national events. This"
"is because the data do not meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"3. 'Unreliable' appears for rates when there are fewer than 20 deaths in the numerator. This is because the figure does not meet"
"the NCHS standard of reliability or precision. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#Unreliable."
"4. County-level data are shown only for counties with populations of 250,000 persons or more. Data for all counties with fewer"
"than 250,000 persons within a state are combined together under the label ""Unidentified Counties."""
"5. A portion of Adams county (FIPS code 08001) was moved into Broomfield County, Colorado (FIPS code 08014), which was created"
"effective November 15, 2001 from parts of four counties: Adams, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld. However, this new county does not"
"appear on this file."
"6. The independent city of Baltimore, Maryland (FIPS code 24510) is reported separately from Baltimore county (FIPS code 24005)."
"7. Dade county, Florida (FIPS code 12025) was renamed Miami-Dade County (FIPS code 12086) effective November 13, 1997. However,"
"the area is coded to Dade (12025) for all years."
"8. Bronx, New York (FIPS code 36005) represents Bronx Borough, New York City."
"9. Kings county, New York (FIPS code 36047) represents Brooklyn Borough, New York City."
"10. New York county, New York (FIPS code 36061) represents Manhattan Borough, New York City."
"11. Queens, New York (FIPS code 36081) represents Queens Borough, New York City."
"12. Richmond county, New York (FIPS code 36085) represents Staten Island Borough, New York City."
"13. The independent city of St. Louis, Missouri (FIPS code 29510) is reported separately from St. Louis county (FIPS code"
"29189)."
"14. Note that there may be slight differences in the number of infant deaths when comparing the Linked Birth / Death Records to"
"the other vital statistics. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/lbd.html#Weight Factors."
